# Prelude
Java class file ( produced by java compiler ,  whose naming format is \*.class ) can be executed by *Java Virtual Machine*  ( also called **JVM**  ) .  For JVM is available for many platforms , java language obtain its precious features  **Platforms Independent** which means **once write , run anywhere**.
Many java programmers can be curious about it , let's share a journey of exploration !
For purpose of  giving a profile to beginners , this blog will focus on the analysis  of source code . not  the comprehensive illuminate of JVM .

# Class File Structure
*  **Magic  Number**
Only java class file's first 4 bytes code isï½œ "0xCAFEBABE" , which give JVM a fast way to verify a file's format  .

*   **Version Number**
The next 4 bytes indicate the java version of this class file , in which the first two bytes represented minor version name , while  the other two bytes represented major version .

*  **Constant pool**
This section can be broken into two parts ,  pool count in first 2 bytes and the rest  is constant pool table , which store Strings , numbers  and references to classes and methods .

#  Basic Tools
*  *javac  $SourceFilePath*
        javac will compile java code to class file .

*  *javap -verbose $ClassPath*      
        javap  will disassembles a class file to  human-readable  format , we will analyze the result file to understand how class file describe  the java source code

#  Examples
*       **Simplest Function**

*Source Code*
```
public int additionFromTo(int a, int b) {
        for (int i = a; i < b; i++) {
            a=b+a+i;
        }
        return a;
    }
```
*Byte Code*

```
